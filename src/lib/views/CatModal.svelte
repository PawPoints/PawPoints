            <br>
            <p>Welcome to our web page! This platform is designed to help you locate stray cats in your area. Here's how it works:</p>
            <br>
            <p>1. Feeding and Earning PawPoints: Whenever you feed a stray cat and provide photo evidence, you'll earn PawPoints.</p>
            <br>
            <p>2. Sidebar Sections: On the left side of the page, you'll find two main sections:</p>
            <br>
            <p>	a. Tracked Cats: In this section, you can view the locations of all the cats that have been tracked.</p>
            <br>
            <p>	b. Found a Cat?: If you come across a new stray cat, you can use this section to report it. Simply upload a picture of the cat, provide a name, and describe its appearance or any unique habits you've observed. After that, just click on the map to pinpoint the cat's location, and click the "Add Cat" button to submit the cat's information.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We hope you find this page helpful in your mission to care for stray cats and make a positive impact!</p>
